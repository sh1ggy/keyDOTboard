## User Guide
### General Workflow
This will summarise the intended usage of the application 
1. Install and run the keyDOTboard application
2. Select the port that the ESP32 is connected to
3. Go to the create cards screen where you have two options to input the RFID ID of the card that you're using
	1. Input the RFID ID manually
	2. Press the **Load Card Reader Binary** button which will allow you to use the RFID card reader to input the RFID ID into the create card form
4. The password of a created card can be edited afterwards, if you would like to change the ID or name, you will need to delete the card and create it again. 
5. Press the **Sync** button on the home screen
6. Finally, press the **Load Key Binary** button on the home screen to load up the primary binary that will input your chosen password whenever you scan the corresponding RFID card.

Errors will be produced by the program itself whenever relevant with any additional context provided with included terminals on the screens that require them. 

### Ports Screen
1. Choose the port from the list of detected ports that corresponds with the port that the ESP32 is connected to and press **Connect to Device**

	- If you plug in the device after you loaded this screen, you can press **Force Detect Ports** to re-load the list of your computer's ports
2. The terminal will take some time loading up the selected port and detect if there are any pre-existing cards on the ESP32's partition and load them into the program accordingly. 
	- If there are no pre-existing cards, the program will be loaded with an empty cards DB. 

### Home Screen
